[![Credibility Assessment](../../actions/workflows/credibility_assessment.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/openMSL/sl-1-0-sensor-model-repository-template/actions/workflows/credibility_assessment.yml)

Enter a short description of the model.
What is the purpose of the model?
What is the general modeling approach?
What inputs does the model need and what outputs does it generate?

## State of the Art

Describe and reference the state of the art for your specific model.
The state of the art can be put into a separate file in the doc folder.
[This example](doc/sota.md) contains the state of the art for sensor modeling and model validation as well as potential candidates for future models on OpenMSL.

## Modeling Approach

Put details about the inner workings of the model here.
Describe the modeling approach in detail.
What is the structure of the model?
What modules is it comprised of?
What sensor effects are represented in the model and how are they modeled?

## Parameterization

What parameters are used internally?
Which parameters can be set by the user?
Each parameter should have a short description as shown in the following example.

| Parameter                      | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `no_of_beams_vertical`         | Number of beams in vertical direction, e.g. layers, of the lidar    |
| `no_of_beams_horizontal`       | Number of beams per layer of the lidar                              |

## Interface

What interfaces are used as model input and model output?
All required field of the interface shall be named in a list as shown in the following example.

### Input: Required Fields in OSI3::SensorView

* `sensor_view.mounting_position`
* `sensor_view.global_ground_truth.timestamp`
* `sensor_view.global_ground_truth.host_vehicle_id`
* `sensor_view.global_ground_truth.stationary_object.id`
* `sensor_view.global_ground_truth.stationary_object.base.position`
* `sensor_view.global_ground_truth.stationary_object.base.orientation`
* `sensor_view.global_ground_truth.stationary_object.base.dimension`

### Output: Fields in OSI3::SensorData Filled by the Sensor Model

* `sensor_data.timestamp`
* `sensor_data.moving_object.header.ground_truth_id`
* `sensor_data.moving_object.header.tracking_id`
* `sensor_data.moving_object.header.existence_probability`
* `sensor_data.moving_object.header.measurement_state`
* `sensor_data.moving_object.header.sensor_id`
* `sensor_data.moving_object.base.position`
* `sensor_data.moving_object.base.dimension`

## Build Instructions

What are the dependencies for building the model?

Give step-by-step build instructions for supported operating systems.
The following is an example for building a model as an FMU in Ubuntu.

### Build Model in Ubuntu 18.04 / 20.04

1. Clone this repository **with submodules**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/openMSL/your-model.git --recurse-submodules
    ```

2. Build the model by executing in the extracted project root directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir cmake-build
    cd cmake-build
    # If FMU_INSTALL_DIR is not set, CMAKE_BINARY_DIR is used
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFMU_INSTALL_DIR:PATH=/tmp ..
    make
    ```

3. Take FMU from `FMU_INSTALL_DIR`

< The final FMU has to be named according to the repository name. In this example sl-1-0-sensor-model-repository-template.fmu >

## Credits

Give credits to funding or third-party contributions.
If the model is further described in a publication, it can also be named here.

## References

Throughout this readme file, references are to be used, e.g. when citing scientific literature while describing the modeling approach.
This can be done by added a number in the text with a reference identifier, like so: [[1](#Rosenberger2020)</sup>, p. 192].
For longer papers or book sections, please also give the page number, as shown in this example.

Then add the full list of authors, title and journal or conference in this section.
The IEEE citation style [[2](#IEEEStyle)</sup>] should be used.
Here is the bibliography from the example above.
